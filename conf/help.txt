attempt to identify its well. If nothing matches the
regular expression, the well from within the file
is used instead.
}

settings,glob_individual {

specific read is being 'held'. If enabled,
the 'held' read will stay in background. If
disabled, the 'held' read will use the graph
for its own.
}

settings,reanalyse {
It happens that fsa files are treated as sequence
files and thereby wrongly analysed, resulting in
peaks occuring at unexpected sizes. To circumvent
such problems, it's recommended to let the application
analyse all files by default.
}

settings,restandard {
It happens that the auto analysis of the internal
lane standard fails, resulting in peaks occuring
at unexpected sizes. If you encounter such shifts,
you can try to let the application reanalyse those.
Be warned though that it can take a long time and
that this is not necessary in most cases.
}

settings,check4update {
If enabled, the application will check our server
for the latest update available and prompt the user
if one is available.
}

settings,showstandard {
If enabled, the application will show wich ranges
are not supported with the internal lane standard
because one or more peaks were missing. This will
result in a shift of the peaks that occur within
this range. Background and line color are the same
as the 'low height marker'.
}

import,convert {
This button allows the user to convert their assay files
from .txt to .enc (if you have the correct permission)
}

import,createkey {
In order to obtain a valid license or to start the 
demo version, you first have to create a valid key
for your personal computer. A license is created
based upon this key and is thereby only valid for
the computer where its key was created.
}

dos,recolor {
If more than 1 read is shown in the dosage plot,
every read has it's own color. If some colors
are unclear you can reassign colors by pushing
this button.
}

dos,main {
The DosPlot represents the dosage quotients for each amplicon.
If only 1 read is shown in the plot window the inner circles
background color represents the mean height of its amplicons
ranging from black to white (meanH below 5000). If more than
1 read is shown, only the reads with good quality (according
to the settings) are shown. The reads that are not shown are
colored red in the legend.

Right clicking on a data point, will show its read in the Main
and ListBox window. Left clicking will show/hide the data values.
}

dos,show {
Select here if you want all active reads
to be shown in the dosage plot or one-by-one.
}
