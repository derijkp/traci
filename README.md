This should exclude any permission issues of the operating system regarding the installation of software on your computer. 
The application works anywhere so you can put the unpacked folder anywhere you like.

The binaries include the binaries for the pattern allele caller (pac, available at https://github.com/derijkp/pac)
that does the initial automated geneotyping
